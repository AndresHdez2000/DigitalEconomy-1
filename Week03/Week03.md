### The growth of the digital economy
Due to everything happening because of COVID-19, we extended our digital technologies dependency to basically every aspect of our lives, school, work, entertainment, social gatherings, groceries, etc. they all depend on people from around the world to interact with each other. We can see that from our own difficulties getting acquainted with software such as Skype, Microsoft Teams, Cisco Webex, and other school platforms, as well as the way the whole internship process works. Now there are more possibilities given the fact that companies around the world now adapted to work remotely, as well as the fact that we now generate way more information than we did before. Every phone call, video call, text message, email, purchase now done online instead of on site. That generates more information, which needs more storage space, which requires more people to design, process, store, as well as oversee the online security. We can add the people who manage these teams and the new departments created, all of this just from a “small” tweak in the way we interact. That’s how quickly we made the new economy grow in a span of less than two years.

### ICT-based business models
We could compare the work of an architect and the work of a manager, given the right conditions. An architect planning a building needs to father information about many things (environment, stakeholders, legal boundaries, etc.) as well as analyzing and discussing different ideas with their teams and investors. Once they have an idea, they can start sketching their way through meetings until it finally ends up on a set of plans. A manager works in the same way, creating a strategy and setting up a business model that can be considered viable, as well as overseeing the implementation in all aspects of it (processes, structure, and ICT). 

You can also understand it as physical vs social planners in a way. While architects use sophisticated software tools to plan the buildings, managers on the other hand use word processors and maybe some graphical tools to plan and implement logic into their business. A modern manager on an ICT-based business model will focus on each point of the ICT indicators to plan the strategy, then on e-business opportunities for the business model and will end up with the company adapting to e-business processes. After all, the majority of recent publications of international organizations stress the fact that the encouragement and support of e-entrepreneurship is indispensable if developing countries don’t want to miss out on the possibilities of ICT.

### Strategic Data Analysis
Data acquisition and analysis are critical elements in strategic measurement and control system effectiveness. A representative strategic data analysis process is illustrated in Figure 1., it contends that ‘strategic controllers’ should undertake such a process in order to better understand the underlying drivers of strategic results.

Different authors have long argued that data analysis allows individuals and organizations to better understand and identify factors that could trigger that need for a change in the strategy. These factors also become reliable because they can be verified, tracked to their root data and source. 
### Describe ICT patents

THe ICT paterns baisclly ttries to make a whole protection of the different systems that are related to the ICT sector, this has become very useful, since 2004 the number of patents have increase dratically, in ten years the number of ITC patterns have increase at least 30%, which make it be a good indicator of how usefull they can be. There have been many different countries that have beeen working in the development of ITC projects, this because it has become a way to increase the income, so from this there are some specific countires that have been targeting this project and becoming a big part of the population that extends patterns.The countries that are most revelvant in this section are: USA, Japan and  China. 

### Impact in telecommunications, health, agriculture, science & energy.




### Identify the historical stages of the development of technology.

As it was explained before there are some changes in the number of patents that have been de


### Identify the relevant indicators of the digital economy.

There are many indicators that we can study an take advantage of accoding to different situations, in the case of digital economu, the indicators are stated by the framework from where we are working, when taking the OECD as the main framework to use there are 7 different indicators that we could take as the most importants. To make this different indicators clear, we are going to describe them. 
- Access.- This indicatore refere basically to the availability of the different regions all across the world, what is trying to measure the access indicator is the quality of the infrestructures where the people can have access to the internet, and with that be part of the connectivity of th Digital enviroment
- Use.- The useage that a technology could actually impact to the society, and how the gouverments try to make the implementations of technological solutions into their strategies for being more effective
- Innovation.- This point is essential, because the innovation is a key point to push the actual limits. It has a lot of repecution because the investments in digital technologies increases, and let different project be possible thanks to the innversion and the innovation.
- Jobs.- It foucses in the way we work now a days, and that we most be sure that the digital transformation is not going to make worst the human life.  
- Society.- To make sure that the technologi is being implementated like, becuase of the waterfall spread, besides that the people who is ineterested in adopting a new culture could do it without being hard and with the least requirements as posible
- Trust.- It is the trust that the technologies generate on people, basically, becuase in case that the tehcnologies that we know to keep using it is not a problem, but when you are trying another one it feels different and you feel more secure in the one we know, and that is why it is a challenge and and indicator
- Market openess.- To have an open makert where everyone is capable of trade and invest, is part of the mission of this main. Besides that, the ecommece has been also one of the ones that have become mas relevant because of the pandemic.
