### The growth of the digital economy
Due to everything happening because of COVID-19, we extended our digital technologies dependency to basically every aspect of our lives, school, work, entertainment, social gatherings, groceries, etc. they all depend on people from around the world to interact with each other. We can see that from our own difficulties getting acquainted with software such as Skype, Microsoft Teams, Cisco Webex, and other school platforms, as well as the way the whole internship process works. Now there are more possibilities given the fact that companies around the world now adapted to work remotely, as well as the fact that we now generate way more information than we did before. Every phone call, video call, text message, email, purchase now done online instead of on site. That generates more information, which needs more storage space, which requires more people to design, process, store, as well as oversee the online security. We can add the people who manage these teams and the new departments created, all of this just from a “small” tweak in the way we interact. That’s how quickly we made the new economy grow in a span of less than two years.
